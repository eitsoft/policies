4. Data Sharing

    Data Storage:
    All collected data, including location data, is stored securely on our servers. We do not share this data with third parties.

    Shared Preferences:

    Transmission Security:
    All data transmitted from the app to our servers is secured using a secret key, ensuring that data is encrypted and protected during transfer.

    While we do not store personal data, we implement robust security measures to protect the location data collected during invoice creation. This includes secure servers and encryption protocols to prevent unauthorized access.
